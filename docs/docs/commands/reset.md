The `reset` command allows you to remove **ALL** monitored artists and releases regardless of profile. The `reset` 
command does not remove any profiles. To remove a profile, see the [profile]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link docs/commands/profile.md %}) docs.

```bash
user@localhost:~$ deemon reset
** ALL ARTISTS AND PLAYLISTS WILL BE REMOVED! **
:: Type 'reset' to confirm: reset
Database has been reset
```
